# Contributing to polyfill.io

â™¥ [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/) and want to get involved?
Thanks! There are plenty of ways you can help!

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return,
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing
patches and features.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Good pull requests, such as patches, improvements, and new features, are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

Please **ask first** if somebody else is already working on this or the core developers think your feature is in-scope for Create React App. Generally always have a related issue with discussions for whatever you are including.

Please also provide a **test plan**, i.e. specify how you verified that your addition works.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project
owners to license your work under the terms of the [MIT License](../LICENSE.md).

## Cutting a Release

Every merge to the master branch will trigger a release to [staging]. When ready to deploy to [production], follow these steps: 

1. Open a terminal to the root folder of the repository and ensure that the latest version of master is checked out. `git checkout master && git pull origin master`
2. Create a new branch to make changes into. `git checkout -b [name]`
3. Follow the interactive release process. `npm run release`
4. Push the changes to GitHub and make a Pull-Request. `git push origin [name]`
5. Merge the Pull-Request and create a new GitHub release with the same version that is in the `package.json` file. This triggers [circle-ci] to deploy the service and to publish the package to [npm].
6. Announce the release on the [@polyfillio] Twitter account.
